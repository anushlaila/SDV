Student Details and document verification through Blockchain

The problem of fake degrees and certificates has serious and alarming proportions and needs to be urgently tackled. Blockchain technology can improve the document verification process and combats document fraud . Blockchain technology simply can be defined as a distributed ledger, that chronologically stores a chain of data packed into sealed blocks. In this all the details of the student are uploaded and can be updated by itself, the student itself can upload his documents on IPFS(Interplanetary File system- distributed database ) and the hash of that document which is generated from IPFS can be stored on the blockchain. Any company can register here and request students for viewing its documents, the student can customize what he wants the company to see and can grant access to the company. Background verification is a tough job for a company but with this system, verification can be simplified.
